### Introduction
1. Using the rule-based parser tree to label where Apsect & Opinion spans possible in a sentence
2. Aspect & Opinion Extraction uses the two-layer 
3. First layer only extract a single Aspect or Opinion
4. Second layer extract the pair of Aspect & Opinion
5. Use the first and second layer to cross-validation
6. Loss is the cross Entropy, & Calculate correlation with each the model outputs
7. Self-train: Use the train data that is predicted correctly (in four models)
